# Functional Dom Query

I've been working on this functional implementation of jQuery.

Except it's not a functional implementation of jQuery, it's a functional implementation of:

- DOM traversal
- Element modification
- Markup creation
- Events

All sort of vaguely in the _style_ of jQuery. The API is very similar in its naming conventions. 

## Why?

I wanted to make a jQuery-esque implementation that used all of my favorite parts of jQuery without all of the bloat. 
I typically use jQuery to make traversal of the DOM, element modification, events, etc. a lot easier. 

This is a step in that direction. 

_It's even ie8 compatible, too!_
