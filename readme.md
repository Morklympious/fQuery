# Functional Dom Query

Yeah, it's a jQuery thing. I know. Get off my back. 

## Why?

I wanted to make a jQuery-esque implementation that used all of my favorite parts of jQuery without all of the bloat. 
I typically use jQuery to make traversal of the DOM easier so I can add/remove classes. 

This is a step in that direction. 

_It's even ie8 compatible, too!_
